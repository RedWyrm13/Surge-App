Bugs that need to be fixed in Surge Driver

Features to Fix/change/add - Pax
 -Add autocomplete suggestions to the destination search bar. Should eb a way to implement this right from the google maps routes API
 -Make entire signup process less clunky and more seamless
 -Allow pax to set $$ amounts for their rides as filters
    -A passenger sets a ride to be worth to them no more than $20. So the pax is shown drivers that can make the ride within that price range. They can request specific
      drivers to be sent the trip request to.
 -Add error handling for incorrect username/password
 -Add travel advisory to the routes api request. This information can then be added to the ride and displayed to the driver
 -Add a class for user/passenger
 -Add unique id for each user
    -Each id can start with p for pax

Features to fix/change/add -Driver
