# Surge-App
Surge is a ridesharing app that aims to charge riders a fair price based on the distance and the time of the trip. Surge will charge a monthly subscription to the drivers for using the app. Using the subscription based model, we aim to offer rates to passengers at costs much lower than Uber, Lyft and any other platforms out there.

The app is built in Kotlin using Android Studio, which can be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio). [This](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) is a very helpful starting point if you are unfamiliar with Android Studio or Kotlin.
