Current Next Step: Make pax app send ride request to database so that a driver can retrieve it

When a passenger hit's find ride on their app, the ride information (pick up point, drop off point, etc) needs to be sent to the database.
Customer will be able to set a price point for the ride and will be shown all drivers in the area that can satisfy that price. Pax can then send the
drivers ride requests.

Once a driver accepts the ride, the pax gets a notification that the driver is on the way and is shown their location and ETA on a map on screen.

After this I need to add a class for user/passenger
