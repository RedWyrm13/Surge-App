Current Next Step: Make pax app send ride request to database so that a driver can retrieve it

When a passenger hit's find ride on their app, the ride information (pick up point, drop off point, etc) needs to be sent to the database.
Customer will be able to set a price point for the ride and will be shown all drivers in the area that can satisfy that price. Pax can then send the
drivers ride requests.

Once a driver accepts the ride, the pax gets a notification that the driver is on the way and is shown their location and ETA on a map on screen.

After this I need to add a class for user/passenger

#################################I HAVE ADDED THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED THINGS########################################

I need to change the app to pass the info related to the ride. Right now it passes hardcoded values for location.

I need to retrieve the data on the driver app. I need to update the ride entry with the driver's info once a driver has accepted.

I need to clean up the driver and pax classes on the passenger app. I need to add unique IDs for each driver and each passenger.
